    <ul> Ingredients:
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 dash freshly cracked bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <ol> Steps:
        <li>Mix soy sauce, water, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar, mirin, sake, garlic, and pepper in a bowl to
            make a sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Place chicken in an electric pressure cooker. Pour sauce over chicken. Close
            and lock the lid. Select Meat function; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to
            build.
        </li>
        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions,
            about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove lid. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken
            should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C); if not, cook chicken for another 2 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pot and cut up or shred. Mix with the sauce from the pot.
        </li>
    </ol>
